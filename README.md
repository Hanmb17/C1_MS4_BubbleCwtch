## Planning, Design & User Experience

I approached the planning and design of this project with a priority onÂ providing a smooth user experience in line with e-commerce platform expectations. While ensuring I follow the principles of UX design and the five stages of strategy, scope, structure, skeleton and surface. My aim with Bubble Cwtch is to maintain the website's user-friendliness, visual appeal, and functionality in line with its original objectives while working to a deadline.

### Strategy

#### Project Aims

The primary aim of Bubble Cwtch is to provide customers with an intuitive platform to explore and purchase artisanal bath products. The website aims to showcase the unique range of bath bombs, soaps and shower jellies while providing efficient product and order management capabilities for the admin users.

#### Research

I conducted thorough research into similar websites within the cosmetics industry, as well as wider e-commerce sites. This research acted as a base for shaping the layout, design and functionality of Bubble Cwtch.

One significant influence was the product card design on Lush's website. After being inspired by Lush's product cards, I designed a similar product card for Bubble Cwtch that is attractive and user-friendly. Additionally, many websites included an 'add to bag' button in their product cards. Recognising the user benefits of this feature, I implemented it in Bubble Cwtch to simplify the shopping experience for users as it reduces the number of clicks required to purchase a product.

Websites visited for research:
- [Lush](https://www.lush.com/uk/en)
- [Bomb Cosmetics](https://bombcosmetics.co.uk/)
- [Pretty Suds](https://prettysuds.co.uk/)
- [Myddfai](https://myddfai.com/)
