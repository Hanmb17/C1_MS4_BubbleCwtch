## Planning, Design & User Experience

I approached the planning and design of this project with a priority onÂ providing a smooth user experience in line with e-commerce platform expectations. While ensuring I follow the principles of UX design and the five stages of strategy, scope, structure, skeleton and surface. My aim with Bubble Cwtch is to maintain the website's user-friendliness, visual appeal, and functionality in line with its original objectives while working to a deadline.
